            Everyone and no one is “baby.” You call people “baby” when you love them, or when you’re infantilizing yourself via internet meme. For Gen Z, cutesy self-identification as “baby” softens a harsh reality of coming of age in a time where everything is too much or too little—too much pollution, too few jobs, too much debt. Twenty-three-year-old Samia Finnerty’s debut album The Baby deals with “too much” in elegant ways, navigating the trappings of young adulthood with subtle, reflective songwriting and poetic lyrical beauty.

            The Baby is technically Samia’s first full-length project, but she’s been entrenched in the entertainment industry for a while. Her parents are the actors Kathy Najimy and Dan Finnerty, and Samia has been acting and pursuing music for most of her life. When she was 17 and living in New York, she made a fake manager’s email address to help her book shows. On the painful “Is There Something in the Movies?,” she observes the industry as if she’s somewhat removed from it, sing-shrieking “Everyone dies/But they shouldn’t die young/Anyway, you’re invited to set” over a plaintive acoustic guitar.
            
            Like Grand Jury labelmates Hippo Campus and Twin Peaks, Samia favors a sardonically sunny indie rock sound, good for driving in circles around your old high school and thinking about how different you look now. But she sets herself apart with her voice, which is where the truly exciting things happen. It’s dark and smooth like a melted caramel, and she sets it at the forefront of her songs, which are sparse aside from a guitar, a drum set, and occasional airy synth or keyboard. The flexibility of her tone allows her to explore a wide range of feelings, from anger to sarcasm to wry optimism.
